        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Thịt kho</strong> is a comforting meal made of braised pork
            belly and eggs in a caramel sauce. I have memories of eating it over rice. It is sweet,
            salty, and savory. Perfect for winter meals.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb pork belly</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>4 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
            <li>silicone spatula</li>
            <li>8 hard-boiled eggs</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion - chopped into eight</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Nước Màu (Caramel Sauce)</h3>
        <p>First, we need to make the caramel sauce that is used to color the
            thịt kho.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To a saucepan on medium heat, add the sugar</li>
            <li>Stir the sugar continuously with the silicone spatula</li>
            <li>Continue to stir as the sugar melts and starts to turn dark</li>
            <li>Adjust the heat as needed and when the caramel begins to smoke,
            add the warm water slowly to the sugar and stir unti all of the
                sugar dissolves</li>
            <li>Set aside for later</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Thịt Kho</h3>
        <p>Now we can begin cooking the thịt kho</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the pork belly into 1 inch cubes</li>
            <li>Bring water in a pot to boil - enough to submerge the pork</li>
            <li>Add the pork for 2 minutes, then drain and rinse the pork</li>
            <li>Add the fish sauce, salt, and fresh water to cover the pork and
            bring to a boil</li>
            <li>Once the pot is boiling, reduce the heat and allow the pot to
                simmer for 1.5 hours</li>
            <li>For the first 40 minutes of simmering, keep the pot covered,
                stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>After 40 minutes, remove the cover to let the contents reduce</li>
            <li>After a total of 1.5 hours simmering, add the nước màu to the
                pot</li>
            <li>Add the hard-boiled eggs and onion</li>
            <li>Continue to reduce to about 1/3 the starting volume</li>
            <li>Check and season with salt or fish sauce or add water to taste</li>
        </ol>
